# Contrast stretching algorithm


## Introduction
---

### So what is contrast stretching? 
Contrast stretching (often called normalization) is a simple image enhancement technique that
attempts to improve the contrast in an image by stretching the range of intensity values it
contains to span a desired range of values, e.g. the full range of pixel values that the image
type concerned allows.

## Running
---

Run the following code:
```shell
python contraststretch.py
```

## Process
---

The algorithm, works pixel by pixel changing intensities of every pixel in order to get a more enhanced image. It works as shown in the below figures.

The enhanced image generated by the algorithm:
